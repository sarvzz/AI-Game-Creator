## 🚀 Project Overview

1. **Create immersive AI-generated worlds**: Use hierarchical content generation to develop kingdoms, towns, characters, and etc.
2. **Build AI-powered game mechanics**: Design inventory systems and other structured game state tracking mechanisms.
3. **Ensure AI safety**: Implement content moderation and compliance systems using tools like Llama Guard.
4. **Optimize AI performance**: Practice techniques to enhance efficiency while keeping operational costs low.

### 1. **Hierarchical Content Generation**
   - Build game worlds through prompt engineering.
   - Generate structured hierarchies (kingdoms, towns, characters, etc.).

### 2. **Interactive AI Applications**
   - Integrate the generated world into a playable game.
   - Create dynamic, text-based interactive elements.

### 3. **Moderation & Safety**
   - Explore content moderation using Llama Guard.
   - Create and enforce custom content safety policies.

### 4. **Implementing Game Mechanics**
   - Develop mechanics for inventory and state tracking.
   - Parse text data into structured JSON for game logic.
